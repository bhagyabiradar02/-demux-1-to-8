# -demux-1-to-8
The 1-to-8 Demux project designs and verifies a circuit that routes a single input to one of eight outputs using a 3-bit select signal. Implemented in Verilog and verified with UVM, it includes GDS generation via OpenROAD (Sky130HD). The design achieves 22.9 mW power, 15% area utilization, and 0.29 ns slack with no violations.
